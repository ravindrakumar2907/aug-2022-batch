				<h4> About EMS: </h4>
				<p>EMS is a Protal where we can manage the employe details, like employe name, id,salary department. </p>
				
				<p>An employee management system provides managers with insights into their workforce, and helps them to better plan and manage work hours to easily control labor costs and increase productivity.</p>
				
				<p>Employee management system is an application based system, having two applications developed, one for employers to manage employee details and another for employees to mark their attendance. <br/>Every organisation whether government or private uses anr information system[2.] to store data of their staff. However, in India it is found that many small scale industries use pen and paper to keep a record. However, there are many advanced technology systems available that can do this work but they all are costly for these low level industries.</p>
				<p>
				This paper discusses making a system for solving problems for them at a cheaper cost. This system will mark attendance of each employee and calculate the salary of them at the end of month. It also calculates overtime and total working hours of each employee. As in small scale each company has their own holidays preference and variable week off for employees, so all this power is given to the employer to manage holidays and week days of each employee separately. It saves lots of time and has no error in pay calculation hence preventing clashes between HR Team and employees. So that both employer and employee can focus on their work to develop their company.</p>
